# Task Tracker API

This API is a *Level Up* from my other project Task Tracker CLI. 
I'm turning it into an API according to the requirements of the roadmap project. 
It has all of the previous feature of the app, plus the creation of new user and the authentication of user with login token after each request. 
The API runs on Tomcat Server.  

**Description** : API's structure is the classic 3 layers architecture with a Controller Layer(Servlets), a Service Layer(Business logic) and a Persistent Layer(Data acces).
I mainly use standard Java libraries with addition of a few external libraries to help with the parsing of JSON and encryption. 
I use PostMan to send request to the API.
